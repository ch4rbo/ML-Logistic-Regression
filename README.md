# Logistic regression project

In this project a logistic regression model is built to predict if a person will suscribe a term deposit or not based on a dataset from a Portuguese bank with information about their clients.

First, we use a logistic regression with default hyperparameters. In second place, grid serach and cross validation are used to select better hyperparameters.

The performance of the final model has a low recall for the clientes that surscribe a term deposit, more work has to be done to impove this metric. We should try with feature engineering, feature selection and, also, other machine learning algorithms.
